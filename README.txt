Below are brief directions for running the code. There is one main
output file: book.pdf.

I ran the code on Ubuntu 13.04. You might need to make changes to run
the code on other versions of Linux or on other operating systems.

--- Install LaTeX.

--- See the file velthuis.zip. Install the Velthuis package for LaTeX,
    which will allow you to ouput Devanagari (Sanksrit) letters.

    Or go to the following link:

    http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/language/devanagari/velthuis/

--- Run the command "make".

The code can take some time to run. To make it run faster, you can
temporarily comment out or temporarily delete lines in the following
files: book.dn, Makefile.
